<p> My hobby is programming. Iam learning programming since 1year and I am also  student at white hat Junior.My 60 clases are completed.Programming is a creative task: there is no right or wrong way to solve a problem, in the same way that there is no right or wrong way to paint a picture. There are choices to be made, and one way may seem better than another, but that doesn’t mean the other is wrong! With the right skills and experience, a programmer can craft software to solve an unlimited number of problems – from telling you when your next train will arrive to playing your favourite music. The possibilities are constrained only by your imagination. That’s why I love programming.</p>
